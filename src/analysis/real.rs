///Functions and constants for evaluative trigonometric values

///For the most part, these methods are meant for struct representing [real numbers](Real),
///and so, for those, the included functions have their normal meaning. However, in order to
///include the generalizations (such as the complex trig functions), the precise definitions are
///defined in a more abstract way.
///
///Specifically, all of the included methods should satisfy the relevant differential equation definition
///of its function. Specifically:
/// * [Sine](Trig::sin) and [Cosine](Trig::cos) should satisfy
///     * `d/dx cos(x) = -sin(x)`
///     * `d/dx sin(x) = cos(x)`
///     * `cos(0) = 1`
///     * `sin(0) = 0`
/// * [Tangent](Trig::tan) should satisfy
///     * `d/dx tan(x) = 1 + tan²(x)`
///     * `tan(0) = 0`
/// * [Hyperbolic Sine](Trig::sinh) and [Hyperbolic Cosine](Trig::cosh) should satisfy
///     * `d/dx cosh(x) = sinh(x)`
///     * `d/dx sinh(x) = cosh(x)`
///     * `cosh(0) = 1`
///     * `sinh(0) = 0`
/// * [Hyperbolic Tangent](Trig::tanh) should satisfy
///     * `d/dx tanh(x) = 1 - tanh²(x)`
///     * `tanh(0) = 0`
///
///Of course, for Real and Complex numbers, the standard infinite series definitions also apply
///and are most likely the method of computation.

///An exponential ring with Real-like properties
///
///Specifically, this trait should be implemented on any [Exponential Ring](ExponentialRing)
///where the [natural logarithm](Exponential::try_ln) exists for any positive integer and is
///continuous almost everywhere[*][1], the purpose being that the above property guarantees
///a large number of [Real]-like behavior and functions for free utilizing only the exponential function.
///
///In particular, this property can be used to prove that:
/// * This ring contains a form of the positive Rationals: `exp(-ln(x)) = 1/exp(ln(x)) = 1/x`
/// * The logarithm of any positive rational exists: `ln(p/q) = ln(p) - ln(q)`
/// * We can take the nth-root of any rational with `exp(ln(x)/n)`
/// * We can raise any rational to the power of any other rational using `exp(ln(x)*y)`
/// * Any of the above can be extended to all reals using the continuity of the logarithm
///
///Now, it is worth noting that this distinction between the "Real Exponential" and "Exponential"
///is necessarily since certain exponential rings are only possible if they do not fit this description.

///does not output any naturals besides 1
