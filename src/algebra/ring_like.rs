//!
//!Traits for structures with both an addition and multiplication operation
//!
//!While ring-like structures can technically apply to any pair of operations, for ease of use
//!and to stick with mathematical convention, these operations are taken to be specifically addition
//!and multiplication where multiplication distributes over addition.
//!
//!# Implementation
//!
//!This module build upon and behaves in a way similar to the [group-like](crate::algebra::group_like)
//!structures. However, in addition to the basic group traits, the following properties are also considered:
//! * Distributivity:
//!    * Multiplication can act on summed elements independently,
//!      ie`z*(x+y)=z*x+z*y` and `(x+y)*z=x*z+y*z` for all `x`, `y`, and `z`.
//!    * Represented by the [`Distributive`] trait
//!    * Note that unlike other marker traits, this one takes a type parameter so that
//!      multiplication between types can also be marked
//!      (such as scalar-vector or matrix-vector multiplication)
//! * The Exponentiation and Logarthm operations:
//!    * Unary operations that map between addition and multiplication
//!    * Represented with the [`Exponential`] trait
//! * Properties regarding partial divisibility and factoring
//!    * These traits _essentially_ measure how "integer-like" a particular ring is by abstracting
//!      many properties and operations commonly associated with integers and natural numbers
//!    * These include, but are not limited to:
//!        * [Divisibility]
//!        * [Primality]
//!        * [GCD]
//!        * [Euclidean Division](EuclideanDiv)
//!        * [Factorizability](Factorizable)
//!    * For more information, see each individual trait's documentation
//!
//!# Usage
//!
//!Similarly to the [group-like](crate::algebra::group_like) module, there are a number of
//!trait aliases corresponding to a system of ring-like algebraic structures that form a heirarchy
//!as represented in the following diagram:
//!
//!```text
//!

//!                   ------Exponential Field--------
//!
//!```
//!
//!Note also that in addition to the above system, there is a complementary system of "Semirings"
//!that follows almost the same exact structure but doesn't require a subtraction operation.
//!
//!For more information, see each structure's documentation
//!
//!# Naming
//!
//!It is worth noting that in mathematical literature, there is some leniency in what certain
//!structures are called, so some trait aliases may be named differently than what some are used to.
//!
//!In particular:
//! * Some mathematicians and literature use the term "Ring" to refer to what is called a "Unital Ring"
//!   here, instead preferring the term "Rng" for Rings without a multiplicative identity. In fact,
//!   this convention is _probably_ the majority considering how little use there is for non-unital rings.
//!   However, the choice was made against using the "Rng" system for the simple reason that it is
//!   obviously highly prone to typesetting errors and is arguably pretty unintuitive for those learning
//!   the terminology.
//! * The term "Semiring" doesn't really have an established meaning in mathematical convention, so
//!   the use here reflects a particular design choice more than a particular standard.
//!

///An irreducible factor as defined here is any element that cannot be written as a product of two

///
///# Uniqueness and Ordering
///
///This trait on its own makes **no guarantees** that the returned factors are unique or ordered
/// in **any** way. The only requirements are that:
///* The product of the factors must be the original number
///* No factors of `1` are included
///* `0` returns `[0]`
///* Only *one* invertible element can be included and must be the first factor
///    * For example, `-6` might return `[-1, 2, 3]` or `[-1, 3, 2]`, but not `[2, -1, 3]`
///
///Importantly, this means does that some structures **can** return different sets of factors
///at different times. For example, in ℤ[√5], `6 = 2*3 = (1+√5)*(1-√5)` are both valid irreducible
///factorizations.
///
///_However_, if the [`UniquelyFactorizable`] trait is _also_ implemented, this is restricted somewhat,

///* There is still no guaranteed ordering, so the lists could be permuted somehow
///* Some factors in the second might be multiplied by some invertible element from the first
///  or return an extra invertible element in the list.
///     * For instance, `-10` might return `[-5, 2]` or `[5,-2]` or `[2,-5]` or even `[-1,5,2]`
///
///Furthermore, there is no requirement for any sort of ordering, as the wide range of possible
///implementing structures gives no obvious standard as to what that would be.
///
///_However_, implementors are highly encouraged to guarantee some sort of ordering and uniqueness
///themselves using their particular properties. For instance, the implementation on the primitive integers
///return all non-negative factors in order of increasing absolute magnitude with a `-1` at the beginning
///for negative numbers, or a polynomial could factor as monic polynomials of increasing degree.

/// * `E(x) != 0`
///
///In addition to these base properties, this trait also stipulates that this function _not_ map
///every element to 1, so as to rule out the trivial case.
///
///Furthmore, to clear up ambiguity, it is important to note that different variations on this
///definition exists. For instance:
/// * As already mentioned, some may allow the mapping to be non-trivial
/// * Some may also allow `E(x) = 0`
/// * For the [Real](crate::analysis::Real) and [Complex](crate::analysis::Complex) exponentials,
///   there are a [multitude][1] of equivalent definitions that have no true effect on the mapping
///
///More importantly though, most authors specify that the `E(x+y) = E(x)*E(y)` for _all_ `x` and `y`
///(such as on [Wikipedia][2])
///However, doing so disallows both the Matrix exponential and Quaternion exponential as well
///as the Clifford Algebra exponential, all of which are, frankly, the only reason to make the exponential
///its own separate trait.
///
/// # Effects on Ring structure
///
///It is worth noting that _any_ ring that has a non-trivial exponential operation must automatically
///have a characteristic of 0 (that is, `1+1+1+...+1` will never equal zero) and hence, has an
///embedding of the Integers within it.
///
///This fact is easily proven as follows:
/// * assume `char(R) = n != 0`
/// * then, for any `x` in `R`, `nx = x+...+x = 0`, and,
///   the [Frobenious automorphism][3] gives that `(x+y)ⁿ = xⁿ + yⁿ`
/// * Hence, `(E(x) - 1)ⁿ = E(x)ⁿ - 1 = E(nx) - 1 = E(0) - 1 = 0`
/// * Thus, we have that that `E(x) = 1` contradicting our assumtions
///
///Additionally, any element that is the output of the expoenential _must_ be an invertible element,
///since <br> `1 = E(0) = E(x-x) = E(x)*E(-x)` implying `E(x) = E(x)⁻¹`
///
/// # Uniqueness
///
///In general, this characterization of the exponential function is *not* unique. However, in the
///vast majority of cases, there is a canonical version that all others derive from _or_ there is only
///one non-trivial case.
///
///For example, most real-algebras have infinitely many exponentials, but we get a canonical form
///stipulating that the function satisfy the classic differential equation `E'(x) = E(x)` or some
///variant.

///Determines if a given Natural number is [prime](Primality) using the
///[Miller-Rabin primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test)
///
///The algorithm works in essence by searching for counter-examples to Fermat's Little theorem, ie,
///that `a^(p-1) = 1` for all `a` in `Z/pZ` when `p` is prime. In general, this tactic only gives a
///way to prove a number is _not_ prime, but with a few modifications to the check and by picking
///the right examples, it is possible to turn this into a deterministic test. \*
///
///Furthermore, this particular algorithm has the surprising benefit of having a runtime that is
///polynomial in the number of bits in the input. Of course, this does not guarantee that this function
///is particularly "fast" per se, but in testing, the algorithm runs reasonable fast for all primitive
///integer types.
///
///\* It is important to note that the particular method used to achieve a Deterministic Miller Robin
///algorithm in polynomial time, _technically_ depends on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. So I
///guess that means that for super huge numbers, this technically _could_ give a false positive... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
///But hey, what _else_ is there? The AKS Primality Test?
