//!
//!Traits for structures with an addition and scalar multiplication operation
//!
//!# Implementation
//!
//!This module builds upon the and behaves in a way similar to the [group-like](crate::algebra::group_like)
//!structures, though, at this point in time, there are no additional properties or operations
//!for structs to consider when targeting this module's systems.
//!
//!# Usage
//!
//!Similarly to the [group-like](crate::algebra::group_like) module, there are a number of
//!trait aliases corresponding to a system of module-like algebraic structures that form a heirarchy
//!as represented in the following diagram:
//!
//!```text
//!        Affine Space    Additive Abelian Group
//!             |                   |
//!             |              Ring Module
//!             |                   |
//!             ----Vector Space-----
//!                      |
//!                   Algebra
//!```
//!
//!Where:
//! * A [ring-module](RingModule) is an [additive abelian group](AddAbelianGroup)
//!   with a scalar multiplication operation with elements from a particular [Ring]
//! * A [vector-space](VectorSpace) is a ring-module with scalars that form a field
//! * An [algebra](Algebra) is a vector-space with a distributive multiplication operation
//! * An [affine-space](AffineSpace) is a set with a subtraction operation producing a vector
//!     * <i>for more information see the trait-level documentation</i>
//!

///A product between two vectors or module elements resulting in a scalar that is semi-linear in both arguments
///
///Rigorously, a σ-sesquilinear form is a mapping `•:M⨯M->R` from a Ring Module to its base ring such that:
/// * `(x+y)•z = x•z + y•z`
/// * `x•(y+z) = x•y + x•y`
/// * `(c*x)•y = c*(x•y)`
/// * `x•(c*y) = (x•y)*σ(c)` where `σ:R->R` is some anti-automorphism, usually the complex conjugate
///   or the identity map
///
/// # Notes on Definition
///
///It is additionally worth emphasizing that in general, while there are a number of other properties
///commonly added to this list, none of them should be assumed without the addition of the appropriate
///marker trait. In particular:
/// * `x•(c*y)` may not equal `(x•y)*c`
/// * `x•y` may not equal `y•x`
/// * `x•y = 0` does not necessarily imply `y•x = 0`
///
///However, if these properties are desired, then the following additional traits can be implemented
///or used:
/// * [ReflexiveForm]: `x•y = 0` implies `y•x = 0`
///     * as a consequence, [Orthogonality](SesquilinearForm::orthogonal) becomes a reflexive property
/// * [SymSesquilinearForm]: `σ(x•y) = y•x`
/// * [SkewSesquilinearForm]: `σ(x•y) = -y•x`
/// * [BilinearForm]: `x•(c*y) = (x•y)*c`, ie, `σ(x) = x` for all `x`
///     * If also a [SymSesquilinearForm], this implies `x•y = y•x`
///     * If also a [SkewSesquilinearForm], this implies `x•y = -y•x`
/// * [ComplexSesquilinearForm]: `x•(c*y) = (x•y)*̅c`, ie `R ⊆ ℂ` and `σ(x) = ̅x` for all `x`
///     * If also a [SymSesquilinearForm], this implies `x•y = ̅y̅•̅x`
///     * If also a [SkewSesquilinearForm], this implies `x•y = -̅y̅•̅x`
///
/// # Examples
///
/// * Dot product of finite dimensional spaces and modules: `x•y = Σ(xₖ*yₖ)`
/// * Inner Product of real and complex vector spaces of any dimension
/// * Complex and Hyper-complex moduli: `z*̅w`
/// * The "Cross-Product" in 2D real-vector spaces: `x₁*y₂ - x₂*y₁`
///     * Alternatively, the mapping taking two vectors to the determinant of the matrix with
///      the vectors as its columns
/// * Minkowski metric: `ds² = dx² + dy² + dz² - dt²`
/// * Scalar product of the conformal model of Geometric algebra
